    "##  Introduction to Data Visualization in Decision Tree\n",
    "    Model interpretation and data visualization is very important but There are limited tools .\n",
    "    For Decision tree visualization, there are scikit-learn,dtreeviz .\n",
    "### Why use dtreeviz ?\n",
    "    1 We can see the distribution for each class at each node\n",
    "    2 We can see where is the decision boundary for each split\n",
    "    3 We can see the sample sie at each leaf as the size of the circle\n",
    "### compares to other similar technologies\n",

    "### How to install \n",
    "    Record bugs during installation and operation\n",
    "### show what the best use-cases of the tool.\n",
    "#### Classification decision tree\n",
    "    show how dtreeviz works to plot classification decision tree\n",
    "#### regression tree\n",
    "    show how dtreeviz works to plot regression tree\n",
    "### compares to other similar technologies such as sklearn.tree.export_graphviz\n",
